## Installation

Clone the code to your chosen directory. Run 'npm install' to make sure you have the needed dependencies, and then run 'npm run seed' to get the database seeded. Running 'npm start' from within the develop directory will get the server going. You can then use a program like Insomnia or Postman to test the routes.

## Usage

This system can be used to make an inventory database. You can check current inventory, add, delete, or update individual products. Here's a link to a video walkthough:
